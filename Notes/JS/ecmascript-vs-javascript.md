### Javascript and Ecmascript relation

ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language that is widely used for client-side scripting on the web, as well as server-side scripting and general-purpose programming.

JavaScript is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript. It is a high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is commonly used for client-side scripting in web development, but it is also used for server-side scripting, desktop application development, and many other applications.

ES6 introduced many new features and syntax enhancements to JavaScript, such as arrow functions, let and const declarations, classes, modules, and destructuring assignments. These features and enhancements have made JavaScript more expressive, concise, and powerful, and have helped to standardize the language and make it more accessible to developers.

While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of ECMAScript, there are other implementations as well, such as Microsoft's JScript, Mozilla's SpiderMonkey, and Google's V8 engine. These implementations all conform to the ECMAScript specification and provide their own optimizations and features.
