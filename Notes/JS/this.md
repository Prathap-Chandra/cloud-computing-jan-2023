### *this* keyword in Javascript

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the object that the function is a method of or the execution context of the current function. The behavior of this can vary depending on how a function is called.

There are several ways that this can be set:

Default binding: If a function is called with no context, the default value of this is the global object (window in a web browser, or global in Node.js) in non-strict mode, or undefined in strict mode.

Implicit binding: If a function is called as a method of an object, this is set to the object that the method is called on.

Explicit binding: The call, apply, or bind methods can be used to explicitly set the value of this for a function.

Arrow function binding: In arrow functions, the value of this is determined lexically, based on the enclosing scope where the function is defined.


```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
}

const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: greet
};

greet(); // logs "Hello, my name is undefined"
person.greet(); // logs "Hello, my name is John"

const otherPerson = {
  name: 'Jane'
};

greet.call(otherPerson); // logs "Hello, my name is Jane"

const arrowGreet = () => {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

arrowGreet.call(otherPerson); // logs "Hello, my name is undefined"
```

In the first example, this is set to the global object when greet is called without a context, and is set to the person object when greet is called as a method of the person object.

In the second example, this is explicitly set to the otherPerson object using the call method.

In the third example, arrowGreet is an arrow function, so this is determined lexically based on where the function is defined, and is not affected by the call method.
