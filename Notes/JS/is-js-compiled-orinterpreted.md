### Is Javascript a compiled languaged or an interpreted language. 

JavaScript is generally considered to be an interpreted language. This means that the code is executed by an interpreter at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code ahead of time like some other languages.

When you run a JavaScript program, the source code is loaded into memory and then executed by the JavaScript engine, which interprets and executes the code line by line. This makes JavaScript a very flexible and dynamic language, as you can modify the code at runtime and see the results immediately.

However, modern JavaScript engines also use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to improve performance. The engine can analyze the code as it is being executed and optimize it for better performance. This can include compiling parts of the code into machine code for faster execution. So while JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, the use of JIT compilation means that it can also be considered a compiled language to some extent.
